Projects for the Artificial Intelligence class 2018-2019 in NTUA ECE

These projects depict a smart taxi service. The inputs are in csv files and the outputs are kml files.

# 1st Project
In the first project we created a java based service where a client can call for a taxi and based on their geographical position alerts the closest taxi and provides the closest routes from the clients position to their destination. 
We implemented a variation of the A* algorith so that it returns alternate best routes.

# 2nd Project
Here we improved the 1st project by adding some extra criteria using Prolog. In order to implement the Java-Prolog "communication" we used JIProlog.
